        <h2>Write-up</h2><br>

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>This dataset was taken from Chicago Police Departments's CLEAR program.
            In this database, there are all instances of crime reported in Chicago
            from 2001 to the present day. For each report, we looked into the year
            and amount of each type of crime committed (eg. theft, burglary, etc). Our goal was to visualize the crime
            count over time, categorized by the type.</br></br> </p>

        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>We ended up picking
            a line graph as is it is quite effective in comparing data over time. Line
            graphs would also make it easy for the user to compare trends. We considered taking
            other subsets of data and visualize using bar charts; one approach we thought of
            was comparing districts and crime rates. We ultimately decided to pick a line graph
            since we wanted to show trends over time.<br /><br />

            <i>Required features</i>:<br> We allow the user to highlight each line (type) on the graph to see more info
            on how many reports were there on that year. (Category 2) We also allow the user to filter
            certain types of crimes by using checkboxes at the bottom. (Category 1)<br /><br />

            <i>Discussion</i>:<br>
            In particular, we felt that it would be most helpful for users to be able to compare trends of different
            crimes over time, and also compare them with the overall trend in all crimes. For this, we decided to add
            checkboxes for users to select the crimes they wanted to view, which also helps with decluttering the data.
            We implemented a scaling y-axis that adjusts based on the max of the data currently selected, so this allows
            users to more clearly observe trends within crimes that are less frequent without sacrificing the ability to
            analyze all of the different crime types. Along similar lines (get it? ðŸ˜Š), we also made sure our tooltip
            provided the
            crime count number at an appropriate scale so as to not include too much information (the exact total) while
            also
            still providing a number in the thousands to show the extra detail.<br /><br />

            For more specific elements of the chart interface, considering the issue that dual axis charts have of the
            drastic impact of axis scales, we decided that the scaling y-axis would help mitigate this because of the
            variety of views that the users can generate. This would help the user get a more general sense of the crime
            trends in the context of several other categories to avoid any dramatic bias.<br /><br />

            We also decided to add a tooltip selection (elaboration) by considering the user's desire to evaluate the
            information, as
            in Bloom's taxonomy for learning. Showing the exact counts within each line helps the user put its magnitude
            both within the context of the same crime and different crimes, while cross-comapring within different years
            as well if they would like.<br /><br />

            <i>Reflections:</i><br>Overall, we found this assignment to be challenging to implement because of how we
            had to incorporate
            our
            intended design using the very high-level methods that d3 provides. However, we found existing documentation
            to
            be very helpful in figuring out issues. We believe we were successful in creating a highly customizable,
            clean visualization that
            effectively showcases visual comparisons of trends in crime.

        <h3>Development Process</h3>
        <p>Work was split among team members via communication and updates on what needed to be
            done. We both took time seperately to work on the project and push to the repository
            while the other waited. We could have been more efficient at working concurrently,
            however we did not split up the tasks formally. We also ran into an issue of working
            on the project at the same time and pushing two different versions. We roughly spent 15
            (Candace: 8, Calvin: 7) hours on this project so far, and the longest part was figuring
            out how to draw the lines, particularly because of the data format by year and grouped by type. We found the
            selection.data and selection.join functions to be complex for this purpose, and unfortunately could not
            figure out how to implement more transitions with join. Time was
            also spent formatting the rows of checkboxes and legends to fit appropriately and look nice.

        <h3>Summary of AI</h3>
        <p>We used ChatGPT to give us an example of line graphing in d3, which was initially referenced. We also asked
            it to create a list
            of colors for us to use.
